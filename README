ConChord is a linux daemon that'll take any linux controller (using the classic joystick API e.g. /dev/input/jsX) and allow it to be used as a chording keyboard, currently it uses xdo to emulate X keystrokes

Dependencies:
	xdotool (for libxdo)

TODO:
	don't use xdotool
	allow for generic evdev devices instead of using the legacy api
